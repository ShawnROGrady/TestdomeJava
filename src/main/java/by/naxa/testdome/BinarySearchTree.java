 This code is a practice Java interview question from testdome.com
 https://www.testdome.com/questions/java/binary-search-tree/12975?visibility=1&skillId=4
 
 Problem statement: Write a function that checks if a given binary search tree contains a given value.
 	-Binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree where the value of each node is larger or equal to the values in all the nodes in that node's left subtree and is smaller than the values in all the nodes in that node's right subtree.
 
 +Passes 3/3 test cases
