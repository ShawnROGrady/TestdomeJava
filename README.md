# TestdomeJava

Since I have been out of school for a few months, I figured that I could use some extra practice with Java to make sure I maintain my level of profficiency. 

In this repository I am answering some sample Java interview questions supplied by testdome.com [(link to full set of questions)](https://www.testdome.com/d/java-interview-questions/4).

## Project Structure

* src/main/java - content directory for application source code
* src/test/java - content directory for tests source code

Package `by.naxa.testdome` contains a set of files.

Each file in this package corresponds to one of the questions from the link above. While I assume the filenames will be descriptive enough to know which files correspond to which questions, I will also provide a direct link to the question I am answering in the header comments of the file. 

## Tools

Initially, all code was written and tested in Eclipse IDE for Java Developers, Version Neon Release (4.6.0)

Now the code is tested in IntelliJ IDEA (version 2019.1).

Build system: Gradle.

## Build

Using Gradle:

```bash
gradlew build
```
